# snake_game_using_python
Snake game made using python as a part of 100 days of code python bootcamp by Angela Yu in Udemy. This is a modified version of that game which can be played by two players.
This game can be played by running main.py or opening main.exe. It was the first time I converted a .py file to a .exe file. So, I am not sure if the .exe file would work properly on other computers.
The game has some bugs and needs improvisation. 
I hope that you would enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it. :)
